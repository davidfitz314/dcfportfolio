      <p>My name is David ChenFitzgerald. I am a Computer Programmer and It Technician.
      I live in St. George UT, and I love travelling to new places. I got married in 2017 to a beautiful Chinese graphic web designer and from then on have improved my own apps greatly due to her influence.
      I currently take on freelance programming projects the most, because I feel every person has new and interesting app ideas, but they just don't know how to publish them, so i do my best to help.

    <p>Extra Interests</p>
    <p>I volunteer to help teach kids programming, because I believe the worlds technology will only grow greater with new minds coming to help.
    I am also a cellist, and truly enjoy incorporating music into my apps.
    I love encryption, number theory, and statistics, to figure out a new solution to a problem or just to make something better is astounding to me.</p>
