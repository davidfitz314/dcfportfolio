      <h2>BIO</h2>
      <p>My name is David ChenFitzgerald. I am a Freelance Software Developer and IT technician.
        I live in St. George UT, and I love travelling to new places, playing cello, and programming.
        I enjoy building Android apps the most, but the feeling you get when you solve any kind of programming problem is amazing.
        It pushes me forward to learn more and solve even harder problems, simply put it's the most fun/difficult puzzle I could ever play with!
