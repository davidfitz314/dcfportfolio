      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Welcome, My name is David ChenFitzgerald and I am a Software Developer and IT technician.</h3>
      <p>I love Computer Programming and Information Technology;
        I have a Bachelors in CIT emphasizing CS.
        I am an accomplishment oriented person, itâ€™s similar to goal oriented,
        but instead, I try to see the big picture alongside of each smaller goal.
        I am great at working in teams, and I enjoy communicating and getting to know about my project partners.
        I have been in customer service for quite some time and I have learned to excel at it,
        by giving customers great support. I am also a relaxed person who knows how to get tasks done on time.</p>
